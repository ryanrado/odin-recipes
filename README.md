# odin-recipes

first odin project creating a basic recipe webiste. see how it goes as i've understand the majoirty of stuff. currently struggling with the commands and remembering how to move files

As I come to completion of this task. my takeaways are: html language was easy for me to understand. no struggles.

i had difficulties in keeping the files organized which led to my files not being in the right origin for git. issue was fixed as i had 2 separate odin-recipes files.

second issue is remembering how to git commit and load things up to github.
